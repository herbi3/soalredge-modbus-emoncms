# soalredge-modbus-emoncms

All of this has been built off https://github.com/nmakel/solaredge_modbus with my own modifications.

Post data from my solaredge devices (x3 inverters, x3 meters and x3 batteries) into emoncms > telegraf > influxdb then visulised within Grafana.

Publically available dashboard at https://public.winterfell.tv/
